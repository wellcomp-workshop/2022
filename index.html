        With the advancements in ubiquitous computing, ubicomp technology has
        deeply spread into our daily lives, including office work, home and
        house-keeping, health management, transportation, or even urban living
        environments. Furthermore, beyond the initial metrics commonly applied
        in computing, such as ``efficiency'' and ``productivity'', the benefits
        that people (users) get from well-being-aware ubiquitous technology have
        been greatly emphasized in the recent years. Through the fifth
        ``WellComp'' (Computing for Well-being) workshop, we will discuss and
        debate the contribution of ubiquitous computing towards users'
        well-being covering both physical, mental, and social wellness (and the
        combinations thereof), from the viewpoints of various different layers
        of computing. Organized by a diverse international team of ubicomp
        researchers, WellComp 2022 will bring together researchers and
        practitioners from both academia and industry to explore versatile
        topics related to well-being and ubiquitous computing.
