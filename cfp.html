        Call for Papers: WellComp 2022 (5th International Workshop on Computing
        for Well-Being)<br /><br />In conjunction with ACM UbiComp 2022<br />All
        Over the World<br />September 11 2022 - Workshop Date<br />http://WellComp.org/2022/<br /><br />Workshop
        Theme and Goals<br />-------------------------------------<br />In the
        advancing ubiquitous computing age, computing technology has already
        spread into many aspects of our daily lives, such as office work, home
        and house-keeping, health management, transportation, or even cities. We
        have been experiencing that much of the influence from those
        technologies are both contributing to a better quality of life (QoL) of
        our individual and organizational lives, and causing new types of stress
        and pain at the same time. The term "well-being" has recently gained
        attention as a term that covers our general happiness and even more
        concrete good conditions in our lives, such as physical, psychological,
        and social wellness.<br /><br />An increasing number of researchers,
        engineers, and people are paying attention to how their work can
        contribute to the better quality of lives, social good, and well-being.
        In spite of recent activities in academia and the society, unified
        academic research activities on computing and well-being is anticipated
        within the ubicomp research community. Active research not only in the
        HCI domain but in various other ubicomp research areas (systems,
        mobile/wearable sensing, mobile computing, persuasive applications and
        services, behavior change, etc.) are needed towards drawing the big
        picture of "computing for well-being" from different viewpoints and
        layers of computing. For example, an additional viewpoint of users'
        well-being in activity recognition researches may invent new types of
        applications that comprehensively cover different types of recognition
        of user's physical, mental and social activities. Ever since Mark Weiser
        introduced the term of ubiquitous computing, the ubiquity of computing
        in our daily lives and society has been certainly progressing. Now it is
        time for the community to more seriously envision the benefits that such
        computing technologies can bring.<br /><br />Users of digital devices
        are increasingly confronted with a tremendous amount of notifications
        that appear on multiple devices and screens in their environment. If a
        user owns a smartphone, a tablet, a smartwatch and a laptop and an
        email-client is installed on all of these devices an incoming e-mail
        produces up to four notifications – one on each device. In the future,
        we will receive notifications from all our ubiquitous devices.
        Therefore, we need a smart attention management for incoming
        notifications. One way for a less interrupting attention management
        could be the use of ambient representations of incoming
        notifications.<br /><br />Following our successful 4 workshops (WellComp
        2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021), this year we will bring together people
        from industry and academia who are active in the areas of activity
        recognition, mental health, social good, context-awareness and
        ubiquitous computing. The main objective of WellComp 2022 is to share
        the latest research in various areas in computing, related to users'
        physical, mental, and social well-being. Especially this year's special
        attention will be drawn to "management of personal well-being in the
        post-pandemic world". Relevance to such topics will be considered in the
        paper review and selection process. Furthermore, the workshop aims to
        identify future research challenges, research opportunities, and
        applications of our research outcomes to the society. <br />The topics
        of interest include -but are not limited- to the following:<br /><br />Definition
        and representation of well-being in computing<br />Predictive modeling
        of well-being metrics and computational models<br />Systems with
        well-being-awareness<br />Measurement of well-being with ubicomp
        technologies<br />Management of physical wellness and well-being<br />Management
        of mental health and well-being<br />Management of social good and
        well-being<br />Innovative well-being applications<br />Behavior design
        / feedback design for well-being application<br />Computing and
        well-being of children, disabilities, or elderly people<br />People's
        well-being in various situations (e.g., smart home, smart cities and
        connected communities, classes)<br />People's well-being and new types
        of community driven by ICT (e.g., sharing economy)<br /><br />Submission
        details<br />------------------------<br />A paper should have a length
        of maximum 4 pages in the new SIGCHI Master Article Template and will be
        reviewed by at least two workshop organizers. Successful submissions
        will have the potential to raise discussion, provide insights for other
        attendees, and illustrate open challenges and potential solutions. All
        accepted publications will be published on the workshop website and in
        the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of each accepted paper
        needs to register for the conference and the workshop itself. During the
        workshop, each paper will be presented briefly by one of the authors. In
        addition, there will be room for demonstrations as well as discussions.
        <br />All papers need to be anonymized.<br />Submissions or any
        questions should be mailed to wellcomp-org [AT] sfc.keio.ac.jp.<br />Please
        submit your paper on EasyChair at [URL TBD]<br /><br />Important
