      <h2>Workshop Theme and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        In the advancing ubiquitous computing age, computing technology has already spread into many aspects of our daily lives, such as office work, home and housekeeping, health management, transportation, and even cities. <b>We experience the influence of those technologies which are both contributing to a better quality of life (QoL) in our individual and collective lives, and causing new types of stress and challenges at the same time</b>. The term "well-being" has recently gained attention as a concept that covers our general happiness spanning as physical, psychological, and social wellness.

      </p>

        <p>
          An increasing number of researchers, engineers, and practitioners are paying attention to how their work can contribute to a better quality of life, social good, and well-being. Despite recent activities in academia and society, unified academic research activities on computing and well-being are still underexplored within the ubicomp research community. <b>Active research not only in the HCI domain but in various other ubicomp research areas (systems, mobile/wearable sensing, mobile computing, persuasive applications and services, behaviour change, etc.) is needed towards drawing the big picture of "computing for well-being" from different viewpoints and layers of computing</b>. For example, an additional viewpoint of users' well-being in activity recognition research may invent new types of applications that comprehensively cover different types of recognition of users' physical, mental, and social activities. Ever since Mark Weiser introduced the term ubiquitous computing, the ubiquity of computing in our daily lives and society has been certainly progressing. Now it is time for the community to more seriously envision the benefits that such computing technologies can bring.
      </p>

        <p>
         For instance, users of personal devices are increasingly confronted with an overwhelming number of notifications that appear on multiple devices and screens in their environment. If a user owns a smartphone, a tablet, a smartwatch, and a laptop, and an email client is installed on all of these devices, an incoming e-mail produces up to four notifications – one on each device. Therefore, we need smart attention management for incoming notifications and one way for attention management could be the use of ambient representations of incoming notifications.
      </p>

        <p>
          Following our successful 4 workshops at UbiComp (WellComp 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021), this year we will bring together people from industry and academia who are active in the areas of activity recognition, mental health, social good, context-awareness and ubiquitous computing. <b>The main objective of WellComp 2022 is to share the latest research in various areas of computing, related to users' physical, mental, and social well-being</b>. Especially this year's special attention will be drawn to "management of personal well-being in the post-pandemic world". Relevance to such topics will be considered in the paper review and selection process. Furthermore, the workshop aims to identify future research challenges, research opportunities, and applications of our research outcomes to society.

      </p> 

        <p>The topics
        of interest include -but are not limited- to the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Definition and representation of well-being in computing</li>
          <li>Predictive modeling of well-being metrics and computational/ML models</li>
          <li>Systems with well-being awareness</li>
          <li>Measurement of well-being with ubicomp technologies</li>
          <li>Management of physical wellness and well-being</li>
          <li>Management of mental health and well-being</li>
          <li>Management of social good and well-being</li>
          <li>Innovative well-being applications</li>
          <li>Behavior design / feedback design for well-being applications</li>
          <li>Computing and well-being for children, people with disabilities, or elderly people</li>
          <li>Peoples' well-being in various environments (e.g., smart homes, smart cities and
          connected communities, classes)</li>
          <li>Peoples' well-being and new types of community driven by ICT (e.g., sharing economy)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <h2>Submission
        details</h2>
        <p>
         A paper should have a length of a maximum of 4 pages in the ACM sigconf template with 2 columns and will be reviewed by at least two workshop PC members or organizers. Successful submissions will have the potential to raise discussion, provide insights for other attendees, and illustrate open challenges and potential solutions. All accepted publications will be published on the workshop website and in the ACM Digital Library as part of the UbiComp 2022 proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper needs to register for the conference and the workshop itself. During the workshop, each paper will be presented briefly by one of the authors. In addition, there will be room for demonstrations and further discussions.

          
        </p>

        <p>All papers need to be anonymized. Any
        questions should be mailed to wellcomp-org [AT] sfc.keio.ac.jp.
