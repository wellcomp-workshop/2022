        <p><b>Title:</b> Oblivious physiological monitoring to anticipate health events </p>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will share some of the experiences we made bringing novel sensing technologies into the wild and deploying them in representative environments for real-world insights. My talk will focus on our efforts in cardiovascular monitoring and its interplay with sleep quality, which jointly are considerable enablers and inhibitors of daytime performance and quality of life. </p>
